# hello-world
This is my first repository. I'm a 22 y-o with no experience in coding, but I am very eager to discover this website's potential and to contribute to it ! Cheers !

I'm currently studiying political sciences, public administration and diplomacy in France. As I said I have no previous experience in coding, but I feel like this could be useful to bring digital change in ageing French institutions.
